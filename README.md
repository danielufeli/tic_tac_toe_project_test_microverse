## How to play the game. 
Tic tac toe is a game of two players. 
Each players chooses chooses a name and an icon as an input.
The resulting board contains 9 cells, each of which is to be filled in turns by the two players until there is no empty slot. 
As soon as the cell's slot are all filled, the game either comes to an end when there is no winner or when a player accumulating icons makes a straight either ways on the board. 
when this happens, there is a WINNER.
The game allows for match on the board on vertical, horizontal and even diagonals for a win.
The player 1 puts his/her name at the prompt to do so do player2. They also choose their icon.


## Rules of the game. 
- Players are not to select an already selected slot.
- You choose a number as visible on the board.
